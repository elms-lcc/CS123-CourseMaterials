# Review

## Bayes' Rule

Bayes rule can be used to train a system on a data set such as:

- Correlation of cancer imaging tests to actual cases of cancer.
- Filtering email spam
- Doing sentiment analysis

This is one method for doing *supervised* *machine learning*.



# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of AI that uses algorithms trained on data sets. These models are capable of <u>predicting</u> outcomes and <u>classifying</u> information.

## Models

When talking about Machine Learning (ML), people often use the term *model*. This term can refer to either:

-  A machine learning algorithm and the methodology for training it.
- A machine learning algorithm that has been trained using data.

**Example of a model:** The *naive Bayes classifier* for detecting spam assigned weights (probabilities) to a set of words. This set of weights along with the algorithm for using them to classify an email message constitute a trained *model*.

## Types of ML

### Supervised learning 

An AI system is trained using labeled data; which means the data has been categorized in some way to indicate what it represents. 

**Example**: email spam detection.

A model is trained on emails that have already been classified as spam or not spam. After training the model can be used to classify new emails as either spam or not spam.

### Unsupervised learning

The system is trained on *unlabeled data* and tries to find similarities, differences, patterns, and structure in data by itself. The system will then classify the samples in the data set according to its own categories.

**Example:** customer segmentation in marketing. 

A business might use data about their customers, such as age, location, and purchasing behavior to determine which customers are similar to each other. Unsupervised learning algorithms, such as k-means clustering, can be used to automatically find patterns in this data and group similar customers together.



### Reinforcement learning

The AI system isn't given any training data, instead it acts as an autonomous agent that accumulates data from trial-and-error attempts to solve a problem or make a decision. It uses algorithms that learn from outcomes to decide which action to take next. 

**Example:** autonomous robots in industrial automation. 

Industrial robots can be programmed to perform tasks such as picking up objects or assembling parts. The robots start with little to no knowledge about how to perform these tasks. As a robot attempts to perform a task, it is given positive rewards for successful actions (like correctly assembling a part) and negative rewards for unsuccessful actions (like dropping an object). Over time, the robots learn to perform their tasks more efficiently by maximizing their successes and minimizing their mistakes. This is all done without explicit programming for each specific task.



## Supervised Learning Models

We've already seen Bayes's rule, which is a statistical methodology (aka model). Here are some others. These can be used for *prediction* and/or *classification*.

### Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)

K-NN, where K represents the number of "Nearest Neighbors" to consider is a methodology in which things (or people) are classified based on a number of predetermined features and grouped (classified) based on the similarity of those features.

**Example:** Real estate comparative market analysis.

Training: A realtor looks at the recent selling price of homes similar to the one they are selling and sets a selling price based on those similar homes. In order to train an ML model to do this, the pertinent characteristics of a home (location, number of beds and baths, etc.) need to be identified and represented numerically so that they can be compared mathematically.

Inference (classification in this case): A home that hasn't sold yet can have its market value estimated by comparing it to several (k) other homes with similar characteristics (NN).

**Example:** Character recognition.

<h4>Training the Model</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data Collection:</b> Gather a large dataset of handwritten characters, each labeled with their correct character (such as the MNIST).</li>
  <li><b>Feature Extraction:</b> Convert each handwritten character into a <i>feature vector</i>. The features could include pixel locations, corner coordinates, location and nmuber of open spaces enclosed by loops, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Model Training:</b> The K-NN algorithm doesn’t require an explicit training step. Instead, it stores all the feature vectors and their corresponding labels.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Classification Using the Trained Model</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>New Character Introduction:</b> When a new, unknown handwritten character is introduced, convert it into a feature vector using the same method used during training.</li>
  <li><b>Distance Calculation:</b> The K-NN algorithm calculates the distance between the new character and all the known characters in the training set.</li>
  <li><b>Finding Nearest Neighbors:</b> The algorithm identifies the ‘k’ (some number) closest known characters to the new character.</li>
  <li><b>Majority Voting:</b> The new character is assigned the label that is most common among its ‘k’ nearest neighbors.</li>
</ul>

### Statistical Models

These methods use mathematical statistics for prediction and/or classification.

#### Bayesian Models

We have already seen an application of naive Bayes classification. There are other ML techniques that use Bayes' rule in other ways.

#### Regression

##### Linear Regression

Covered in class lecture on Tuesday 7/9/24

##### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression (logarithmic odds regression) is a methodology used mainly for binary classification. It predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a given class. For example, it can be used to identify whether an email is spam or not, or to diagnose diseases by assessing the presence or absence of specific conditions based on patient test results. 

In binary logistic regression, a curve is produced by a mathematical function called a *sigmoid function* which squeezes output values into a range between 0 and 1 in a smooth and gradual manner. It’s like a soft switch: instead of abruptly turning ON or OFF, it gradually transitions between the two states.

In the example below, the input, on the x-axis, is the number of hours students studied for an exam. The output, on the y-axis, is probability of passing the exam.

**Other types of logistic regression**

Besides *binary* logistic regression, where data are classified into two categories there are other types of logistic regression that classify data into more than two categories.

- **Multinomial:** There can be 3 or more possible *unordered* categories, such as “cats”, “dogs”, or "sheep".
- **Ordinal:** There can be 3 or more possible *ordered* categories, such as “low”, “Medium”, or "High".



### Tree-Based Models

#### Decision Trees

A *decision tree* is a flowchart-like structure where each *internal node* (aka *decision node*) represents a point where a decision is made based on a rule related to some feature (aka attribute) of the data item being classified. There is a branch for each outcome of the decision. A branch or series of branches will ultimately end in a *leaf node* that represents a final outcome.

The tree is built by a machine learning training algorithm. The ML algorithm works off of labeled data (this is supervised ML) to find features which it turns into conditions for making a decision at the decision nodes in the tree.

**Movie recommendation example**

Start with a dataset of movies that a person likes.

1. **Feature extraction**: For each movie in the dataset, there are features, such as genre, director, length, and so on. These features are used to create the “questions” in the decision tree.
2. **Tree construction**: The decision tree training algorithm builds a decision tree based on the features
3. **Prediction**: When recommending a new movie, the decision tree algorithm uses these features to traverse the tree. At each decision node, it checks the feature of the movie and follows the corresponding branch. This process continues until it reaches a leaf node, which gives the final prediction (e.g., “the user will like this movie” or “the user will not like this movie”).
4. **Recommendation**: The system can then recommend the movies that were predicted to be liked by the user.

    Length -->|Yes| Like
    Length -->|No| DontLike
    Genre -->|No| Actor{Does the movie star Leonardo DiCaprio?}
    Actor -->|Yes| Like
    Actor -->|No| DontLike

```



#### Random Forests

A Random Forest is a collection of Decision Trees. Each tree in the forest is built from a more or less random sample from the training data set. The final prediction of the Random Forest is made by averaging the predictions of each individual tree (for regression tasks) or by taking a majority vote (for classification tasks). This approach helps to overcome the overfitting problem of Decision Trees and generally results in a more robust and accurate model.

### Artificial Neural Networks

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of neural networks in the brains. It consists of interconnected nodes or artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a brain. These are connected in a way that models the synapses in a brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, processes them, and sends a signal to other connected neurons. The strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a weight, which is adjusted during the learning process. They can learn from experience, and can derive conclusions from complex and seemingly unrelated sets of information.
